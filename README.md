This is a URL Shortener SaaS, the utility of a URL shortener but with the a REST API and a web interface to manage your links.

I wanted to make this the easiest possible, not just a generic URL shortener, but a way to centralize, manage and track all your links, to build a secure backend that people can consume and build their own shortener sites or apps on top of it.
